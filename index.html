		 <p class="wordleft">World War II was the deadliest military conflict in history. An estimated total 70-85 million people perished, which was about 3% of the 1940 world population (est. 2.3 billion).Civilians deaths totaled 50 to 55 million. Military deaths from all causes totaled 21 to 25 million, including deaths in captivity of about 5 million prisoners of war. Statistics on the number of military wounded are included whenever available.</p>
	 	</div>

		  <p class="wordleft">According to estimates, the Soviet Union suffered the highest amount of total deaths (including military and civilian) with between 21,800,000 and 28,000,00 dying during World War 2. This is due to the sheer level of manpower provided, the numbers killed in German sieges, and Russian battle tactics that paid little consideration to the preservation of their soldiersâ€™ lives.</p>

			<p class="wordleft">Think about the generations and say that we want to make it a better place for our children and our children's children,so that they know it's a better world for them,and think they can make a better place.</p>

			<h2 class="fontchange">So how about no more war?</h2>
